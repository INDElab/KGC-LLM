King Gustav I ordered the construction of the renaissance castle in 1549, on the present site on a hill south of Uppsala Cathedral, with the old Archbishop's Castle being used for building material and subsequently demolished.\n\nUppsala Castle was built during the time Sweden was on its way to become a great power in Europe. Kings Erik XIV, John III and Charles IX all remodeled and expanded the citadel into a representative Renaissance palace. During Erik XIV's reign, the castle was the site of the Sture Murders. In 1630, King Gustavus II Adolphus announced the decision that Sweden should participate in the Thirty Years' War. It was in the castle that the Swedish government announced the abdication of Queen Kristina in 1654. \n\nUppsala Castle was supposedly seriously damaged by fire in 1702. Reconstruction took many years and was indeed hampered by the remains of the castle being used as a quarry for stone to be used in building Stockholm Palace. \n\nUppsala Castle was the administrative center of Uppland and the site of the Hall of State (Swedish: \"Rikssalen\") for many years.

Thus, the \"Thesaurariat\" at Sibiu, which represented the Imperial Austrian authorities, coordinated mining activities in Transylvania and had an office based in the Hunyad Castle, decided in 1802 to build a second furnace in the Hunedoara area. The site chosen was at the confluence of two rivers close to a group of forge works and iron mines. Construction began in 1806, and although finished in 1810, production only began in April 1813, once the necessary annexes had been built. A tablet placed on the front of the furnace read: \"Augusto Imperante Francisco Extructum 1810\" (\"Built 1810 during the reign of the venerable Francis\").\n\nThe furnace's first period of use was fairly short at seven and a half months, as the crucible had become quite worn and enough cast iron had been generated to last the nearby workshops three years. In all, 1380.3 tons of cast iron were produced. Periods of repair, use and abandonment followed over the ensuing century. In 1837, a fire caused structural damage to the furnace, and an investment of 40,529 forints was approved. Its volume was expanded to 26.45 m3, the water wheel was repaired and the bellows compressor was improved. On August 25, 1840, an air preheater began operating. In 1841, a narrow gauge railway for transporting ore to the furnace's upper opening was installed. Little wagons would load the ore downward into the furnace; this mechanism replaced the inclined planes used earlier. The railway was 246.8 m long and made of cast iron from Govăjdia, and was the first such of its kind in Transylvania, extended to Hunedoara in 1900 (\"see Transylvanian mining railway\"). The cooling systems, the loading mechanism and the continuous production cycle were quite advanced for contemporary Europe. Its most intense period of production took place between 1871 and 1889. Legend holds that metal prepared there as well as at the Reşiţa works was used for raw material in the building of the Eiffel Tower, but there is no documentary evidence in support of this claim. Activity lessened after 1896 due to the new Hunedoara Steel Works. The final repairs were made in 1914–1916, and the last batch of cast iron came out in 1918. The furnace closed down permanently in 1924.\n\nIn 2008, the site was acquired by Ghelari Town Hall because of a failure by Hunedoara Steel Works, the previous owner, to pay taxes on the property. As of 2010, the chimney was intact with the original iron girdles still in place, but the roof was in serious need of repair, and the site was strewn with garbage, although the interior was fairly clean.", "triple_entity_boundaries": [[[4, 26], [75, 82]], [[4, 26], [140, 147]], [[75, 82], [92, 108]], [[75, 82], [140, 147]], [[92, 108], [75, 82]], [[92, 108], [117, 129]], [[92, 108], [140, 147]], [[117, 129], [140, 147]], [[140, 147], [92, 108]]]}, "output": [{"non_formatted_triples_match_status": ["title", "title", "title", "title", "title", "title", "title", "title", "title"], "non_formatted_surface_output": [["Govăjdia Blast Furnace", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Ghelari"], ["Govăjdia Blast Furnace", "country", "Romania"], ["Ghelari", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Hunedoara County"], ["Ghelari", "country", "Romania"], ["Hunedoara County", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Ghelari"], ["Hunedoara County", "part of", "Transylvania"], ["Hunedoara County", "country", "Romania"], ["Transylvania", "country", "Romania"], ["Romania", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Hunedoara County"]], "non_formatted_surface_output_provenance": [["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"], ["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"]], "instance_matching_status": "title", "answer": " <sub> Govăjdia Blast Furnace <rel> located in the administrative territorial entity <obj> Ghelari <et> <sub> Govăjdia Blast Furnace <rel> country <obj> Romania <et> <sub> Ghelari <rel> located in the administrative territorial entity <obj> Hunedoara County <et> <sub> Ghelari <rel> country <obj> Romania <et> <sub> Hunedoara County <rel> contains administrative territorial entity <obj> Ghelari <et> <sub> Hunedoara County <rel> part of <obj> Transylvania <et> <sub> Hunedoara County <rel> country <obj> Romania <et> <sub> Transylvania <rel> country <obj> Romania <et> <sub> Romania <rel> contains administrative territorial entity <obj> Hunedoara County <et>"}]}None

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's population and about 3% of the UK's population. The Northern Ireland Assembly (colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location), established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998, holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas.\n\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. They were generally the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. Meanwhile the majority in Southern Ireland (which became the Irish Free State in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were Irish nationalists and Catholics who wanted a united independent Ireland. Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed by a large minority from all backgrounds.\n\nThe creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During 1920–22, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics. In the following decades, Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front. This unrest sparked the Troubles; a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including paramilitary disarmament and security normalisation, although sectarianism and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued.\n\nThe economy of Northern Ireland was the most industrialised in Ireland, but declined as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles. Its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the \"peace dividend\" and increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, dropping to 6.1% and down by 1.2 percentage points over the year, similar to the UK figure of 6.2%.\n\nCultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. In many sports, the island of Ireland fields a single team, a notable exception being association football. Northern Ireland competes separately at the Commonwealth Games, and people from Northern Ireland may compete for either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympic Games.", "triple_entity_boundaries": [[[1877, 1911], [1785, 1801]]]}, "output": [{"non_formatted_triples_match_status": ["title"], "non_formatted_surface_output": [["First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland", "applies to jurisdiction", "Northern Ireland"]], "non_formatted_surface_output_provenance": [["en_title", "en_title", "en_title"]], "instance_matching_status": "title", "answer": " <sub> First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland <rel> applies to jurisdiction <obj> Northern Ireland <et>"}]}None

Klofáč became one of the best known radical nationalist Czech politicians in the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\nVáclav Klofáč grew up in humble circumstances, the son of a courtroom messenger, he knew poverty and went through a number of experiences that allowed him to understand and sympathize with the working class. Klofáč’s education began in Německý Brod Gymnasium and then at the University of Prague in the late 1880s. He was originally enrolled in the Universities Medical School but transferred into the school of arts and sciences where he studied philosophy. Václav participated in journalism and student politics. His political career began during his years as a student at Charles University in Prague. While attending the University Klofáč became co-founder of the Czech students progressive movement. He was also involved in the Young Czech Party, who defeated the Old Czechs in the Reichstrat election of 1891, and frequently wrote for the \"Časopis Pokrového Studentstva\". After graduation, Julius Gregr editor of \"Národní listy\" convinced Klofáč to write for the paper where he was quickly promoted to editor. But Klofáč became unhappy with what he viewed as the excessive compromising of the Young Czechs with the Habsburg government.\n\nHis frustrations with the Young Czechs led Klofáč to become one of the founders of the National Social party (originally the National Workers party) in 1898. He was elected to the Austrian parliament for the first time in 1901 along with his colleagues Václav Choc and Václav Fresl, where he used his seat in the parliament to attack the government for what he believed were its anti-Czech, militarist and Catholic policies. Unlike many nationalists of his day, Klofáč was an ardent supporter of women's right to the vote. The stridency of his anti-Habsburg politics led to his arrest by the Austrian authorities on charges of treason in 1915. Although he was sentenced to death, Klofáč was amnestied in 1917 along with many other prominent Czech politicians. In 1939 Klofáč escaped a second incarceration, when Bohemia was occupied by the Germans, due to his impending death. From January 1919 to May 1920 Klofáč served as Czechoslovakia’s minister of national defense. \n\nAn avowed pacifist, Klofáč became the first Minister of Defense of Czechoslovakia. Klofáč transformed the recently defeated Austro-Hungarian army into the new Czechoslovak Army. He persuaded most men participating in the armed forces to accept their new civic responsibilities as citizen soldiers and to try and rid themselves of any negative views they had of the military, caused by their experiences in the Imperial and Royal Army. From 1920-1926 Kofláč served as vice-chairman and chairman of the Czechoslovak Senate. During this time he maintained harmony among delegates representing different interest. Václav Klofáč also helped organize the September 1926 Brno Congress of the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party. \n\nA strong supporter of the first Czechoslovak president Tomáš Masaryk. From 1918 to 1938, Klofáč became a publicist for public understanding and support of political democracy and Masaryk’s concept of the Czechoslovak state.
